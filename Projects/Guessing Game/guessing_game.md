# Hangman Game Using Only the print function
- This game uses the following
    - Lists to store the word
    - Uses loops
    - Uses a dictionary to store the player's score
- This game is played using the terminal

- Some improvements that can be made in the future:
    - After the game theme is choosen, the list is selected and the game runs using a block of code
        - The game is currently using an if statement and uses an if else statement to run the game. This isn't efficient because if there were multiple themes, then this process of using conditional statements wouldn't be efficient.
    - The word doesn't change until after the user guesses the correct word
        - The program currently switches the word after every guess
