Some things that I learned while creating this project
- Using ChatGPT can sometimes be helpful for learning (but don't always copy its code since writing code yourself is the best way to learn)
- Learned how to access/update dictionaries
- Learned a lot from this line of code: word_count[every_word] = word_count.get(every_word,0)+1  
    - Learned that on the left side, it turns into the word and on the right side it becomes like a dictionary and adds 1 to the count
        - Example: word_count["Bob"] = {"Bob", 1}
- Learned about: not and in


My biggest takeaway/lesson from this project:
- There is always a much simpler way to write something
- Googling or using AI to help with explaining or giving an example is beneficial, but don't copy code since it doesn't allow you to learn.
